Hi :wave:, I'm a software engineer at <a href='https://www.linkedin.com/blog/engineering/artificial-intelligence'>LinkedIn Core AI</a> working on foundation models for recommendation. I completed my master's in computer science at [NYU Courant](https://cs.nyu.edu/home/index.html), advised by Prof. [Joan Bruna](https://cims.nyu.edu/~bruna/) and Prof. [Jonathan Niles Weed](https://www.jonathannilesweed.com/). I obtained my bachelors degree in Electronics and Communication Engineering from [IIT Guwahati](https://www.iitg.ac.in/).

#### Research
I'm primarily interested in the computational and statistical aspects of learning in neural networks.

- **Learning dynamics:** Understanding the interplay between feature evolution, weight matrix spectra and generalization.
- **Efficiency:** Developing low-level (randomized) algorithms for training and inference of large scale LLMs/GNNs.
