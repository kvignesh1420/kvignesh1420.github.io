Hi :wave:, I'm a software engineer at <a href='https://www.linkedin.com/blog/engineering/artificial-intelligence'>LinkedIn Core AI</a> working on foundation models for recommendation. I completed my master's in computer science at [NYU Courant](https://cs.nyu.edu/home/index.html), advised by Prof. [Joan Bruna](https://cims.nyu.edu/~bruna/) and Prof. [Jonathan Niles Weed](https://www.jonathannilesweed.com/). I obtained my bachelors degree in Electronics and Communication Engineering from [IIT Guwahati](https://www.iitg.ac.in/).

**Research:** I'm interested in understanding the mathematical foundations of deep learning. My work primarily focuses on the dynamics of feature learning in neural networks and on computational techniques for training them efficiently.
